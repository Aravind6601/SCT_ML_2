# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## Project Description
This project performs customer segmentation for a mallâ€™s customer dataset using the K-Means clustering algorithm. It helps identify distinct customer groups based on their annual income and spending score, enabling targeted marketing strategies.

## Motivation
Understanding customer behavior and segmenting them into meaningful groups is vital for personalized marketing and improving business profitability. This project aims to demonstrate how unsupervised machine learning (K-Means) can reveal insights from customer data.

## Dataset
The dataset (`Mall_Customers.csv`) contains the following attributes for 200 customers:
- CustomerID
- Gender
- Age
- Annual Income (k$)
- Spending Score (1-100)

## Tech Stack and Libraries
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn (for K-Means clustering)

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Aravind6601/SCT_ML_2.git
    cd SCT_ML_2
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
    ```

3. Ensure `Mall_Customers.csv` is in the project directory.

4. Open and run the notebook `Task2_KMeans_Mall_Customers.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Task2_KMeans_Mall_Customers.ipynb
    ```

## Summary of Results
The K-Means clustering algorithm successfully grouped customers into distinct clusters based on their income and spending behavior. This segmentation can help marketing teams tailor offers and campaigns for each group effectively.

## Visualization
The notebook includes clear and labeled visualizations showing:
- Distribution of customer attributes
- Final clusters with distinct colors
- Animated visualization of the clustering process
